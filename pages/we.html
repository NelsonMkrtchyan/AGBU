            <p> Women’s empowerment is a global movement accelerating social and economic change across developing
                societies
                worldwide. As this unstoppable march toward female equality and human rights advances, AGBU is working
                to
                ensure that the women of Armenia aren’t left behind. Even today, they remain in a struggle to break free
                of
                outworn social norms that run deep in their local community traditions. These complex dynamics only add
                to
                the daily stresses of scarce employment opportunities and the hardships of many women who have become
                sole
                breadwinners as a result of mass emigration. <br/><br/>To help improve the status of Armenia’s women in
                society, AGBU has launched its Women’s Entrepreneurs (W.E.) program as part of its broader Women’s
                Empowerment initiative. Only applicants who demonstrate a strong potential to gain financial
                independence
                through a micro-enterprise or home business are invited for a personal interview. Once selected, each
                participant receives a full Cycle of Support for one year, including entrepreneurship courses,
                workshops,
                mentoring, and networking, as well as follow ups and check-ins at various touchpoints in their journey.
