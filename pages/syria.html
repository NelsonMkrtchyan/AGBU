            <p>With thousands of Armenians caught in the crossfire of war and terror, AGBU continues to heed the call of
                humanity with urgency and generosity. Since 2012, donors across the globe have provided a direct life

                <br/><br/>The times are still uncertain. And with the latest turn of events in Syria, donor support
                remains critical to this special mission. Together we Armenians embody benevolence at its best,
                especially in the worst of times.

                                        <p>“I was playing outside. A mortar shell burst out of nowhere ripping open my
                                            left leg. Suddenly, I was a teenager bound to a wheelchair. I stayed home
                                            because I didn’t want people to stare at my wound or pity me. I lost many
                                            friends that way. My parents couldn’t afford a prosthetic leg. Then some
                                            caring Armenians from far away read my story in the AGBU magazine. They
                                            collected the money to pay for it. The best way I can thank them is to do
                                            good things in my life. And always stand tall as a proud Armenian.”

                                            Karapetian Center. AGBU distributes its donations regularly through this
                                            office. For over seven years we have been trying to heal the many wounds. As
                                            a fellow refugee from Syria myself, I well understand that there are many
                                            who had considerable wealth in Syria, both moral and material, and lost it
                                            in a few hours. People accustomed to a certain quality of life suddenly have
                                            to find work and face social problems. Many of these refugees fit the
                                            category of highly vulnerable.”

                                            started talking about what they had been through. I was their teacher but I
                                            acted as a mom and psychologist, too. If their parents weren’t comfortable,
                                            the children weren’t either. So, the families were taken care of,
                                            completely. I love the support our school lends, that AGBU lends.”
